# CyberSec LearningPath

It's hard to learn cybersecurity if you don't have the resources for a proper career or just couldn't choose that path in your major or can't pay for a 200 USD course; I know a bunch of friends who've dropped trying to learn cybersec because when you start it's daunting, you first see an intro to, and then it can be unclear what now, then you try solving a TryHackMe or HackTheBox exercise and don't know where to even begin, so I made a path divided by modules using resources from different sites using mostly free resources, I hope it helps.

HackTheBox modules cost quite a lot so I recommend taking Intro to Academy, Basic Networks, and Using Metasploit Framework, don't be afraid to look for tutorials, you're not supposed to be able to solve them right away with your current knowledge

TryHackMe is way cheaper than HackTheBox, it can be about $14 a month or $10 a month yearly, if you're really invested and don't want to take a lot of time investigating by yourself, I recommend getting the $14 subscription and practice modules 30 mins 1 hour a day for about 2 months to make good use of that subscription
